# LearnArt
The project is based on neural networks and weak artificial intelligence. It acts as a smart drawing platform for children and adults. It involves two phases of users. First phase users will be the one who feed the datasets into the into progressive web application that is the adults. Second phase users will be the one who draw and checks its efficiency that is the children. The platform gets trained by all these datasets and recognises the object. The drawing is stored as pixels pattern and checks with the previous data and finds how much percentage does the current drawing is matching with the previous drawings.
